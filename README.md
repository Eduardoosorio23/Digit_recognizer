# **Digit Recognizer**

## Objective:
The objective is to correctly identify digits using thousands of hand written images. I will be using Tensorflow + Keras to practice my skills using simple neural networks.

## Data:
The data provided comes from Kaggle's Digit Recognizer competition. The data consist of one training set with 42000 rows and a test set with 28000 rows. Each row in the training set consisted of 784 columns for every pixel in the image and  1 column for the label. The test set only have 784 columns for the pixels.

## EDA:
Due to this being a competition data set there wasn't really a need for EDA. The data seemed to be evenly distributed with each digit from 0 to 9 ranging from 4000 to 5000 values.
